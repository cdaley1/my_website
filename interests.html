				<p><strong> Favourite Player: </strong> Kobe Bryant </p>
				<p><strong></strong> I got into the sport at a young age and I have been playing ever since. I played through all of my school and college yaers at school and in 7 years, my team only lost one game. I also played for a division 1 national team outside of school, who were also quite successful </p>
